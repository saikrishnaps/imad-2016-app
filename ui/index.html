      <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves.[1] Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy....</p><a href="/articleOne">read more</a>

      <h2>Food</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Saikrihna, Sep 27, 2016.</h5>
      <h5><span class="label label-success">Lorem</span></h5><br>
      <p>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.Historically, people secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry.Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".</p>

      <h2>Healthy Lifestyle</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Saikrihna, Sep 27, 2016.</h5>
      <h5><span class="label label-success">Lorem</span></h5><br>
      <p>A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lowers the risk of being
seriously ill or dying early. Not all diseases are preventable, but a large
proportion of deaths, particularly those from coronary heart disease
and lung cancer, can be avoided. Scientific studies have identified
certain types of behaviour that contribute to the development of
noncommunicable diseases and early death. Health is not just about
avoiding disease. It is also about physical, mental and social wellbeing.
When a healthy lifestyle is adopted, a more positive role model is
provided for other people in the family, particularly children. This
booklet aims to help readers change their behaviour and improve their
health in order to live healthier, longer lives.</p>
